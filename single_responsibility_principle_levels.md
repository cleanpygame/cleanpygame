Ah, the classic "do-everything" function! Our user_manager.py has a function that's trying to be a Swiss Army knife - validating, saving, and notifying all at once.

Remember the Single Responsibility Principle? Each function should have just ONE reason to change. This function has at least three! Let's break it down into focused, single-purpose functions.

"""final
Great job applying the Single Responsibility Principle! You've transformed a monolithic function into three focused functions, each with a clear, single responsibility:

1. `validate_user_input`: Only concerned with validating data
2. `save_user_to_database`: Only concerned with database operations
3. `send_welcome_email`: Only concerned with email communication

This separation brings several benefits:
- Each function is easier to understand and maintain
- Functions can be tested independently
- Changes to one aspect (like validation rules) won't affect other aspects
- Functions can be reused in different contexts

Remember: When a function has multiple responsibilities, it has multiple reasons to change. By giving each function a single responsibility, you make your code more robust and adaptable to future changes.

Excellent work! You've transformed a monolithic class into a well-structured system of specialized classes, each with a single responsibility:

1. `DatabaseConnector`: Responsible only for database operations

4. `ReportWriter`: Responsible only for writing the report to a file

This separation brings several benefits:

"""final
Excellent refactoring! You've transformed a monolithic function into a well-structured set of functions, each with a single responsibility:

1. `read_csv_file`: Only concerned with reading and parsing the CSV file
2. `validate_student_data`: Only concerned with validating student records
3. `analyze_student_data`: Only concerned with calculating statistics
4. `generate_student_report`: Only concerned with formatting and writing the report
5. `process_student_data`: Orchestrates the workflow using the specialized functions

This separation brings several benefits:
- Each function is focused and easier to understand
- Functions can be tested independently
- Error handling is more localized and specific
- Functions can be reused in different contexts
- The main function now clearly shows the processing pipeline

The Single Responsibility Principle isn't just about making code look nice - it makes code more robust, maintainable, and adaptable to change. When each function does one thing well, the entire system becomes more reliable and easier to extend.
