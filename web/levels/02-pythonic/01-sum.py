Ah, I see your colleague is a fan of "artisanal, hand-crafted loops" - painstakingly constructing each calculation from scratch like it's 1995!

They probably also churn their own butter and forge their own paperclips. How quaint! Let's introduce them to this revolutionary concept called "built-in functions" that Python has had since... forever.

Excellent! You've transformed verbose, manual loops into concise, Pythonic code. 

One of Python's greatest strengths is its rich standard library of built-in functions. The Pythonic way is to leverage these built-ins rather than reinventing them. Not only does this make your code more readable and concise, but the built-in functions are often optimized for performance too!

Remember: "Flat is better than nested" and "Simple is better than complex" - core principles from the Zen of Python that these built-in functions help you achieve.
