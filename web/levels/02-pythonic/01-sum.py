Ah, I see your colleague is a fan of "artisanal, hand-crafted loops" - painstakingly constructing each calculation from scratch like it's 1995!

They probably also churn their own butter and forge their own paperclips. Let's introduce them to revolutionary concept of "built-in functions" that Python has had since... forever.

Excellent! Pythonic code!

Python's built-in functions make your code more readable, concise, and often faster.
Remember: "Flat is better than nested" and "Simple is better than complex" - core principles from the Zen of Python.
