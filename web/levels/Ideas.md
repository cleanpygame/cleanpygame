## Code Smells to Use in Levels

### Libraries

* writing json as strings instead of json.dumps
*

### Exception handling

* use exception raise - catch in the heavy loop
* catch exception and print error, instead of letting error go up the stack
* with —Å —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –æ—Ç–∫—Ä—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç —Ñ–∞–π–ª csv –∏ –≤—ã—á–∏—Ç—ã–≤–∞–µ—Ç –∏–∑ –Ω–µ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä–≤—É—é "–Ω–µ–Ω—É–∂–Ω—É—é" —Å—Ç—Ä–æ—á–∫—É —Å –∑–∞–≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∫–∞–º–∏

### üì¶ Sorting Algorithms

Classic problems often written in messy, redundant, or hard-to-read ways ‚Äî great for showing clean refactoring.

3. **Selection Sort** ‚Äî often includes repeated logic, poor naming.
4. **Merge Sort** ‚Äî recursion, clear decomposition, rich with naming opportunities.
5. **Quick Sort** ‚Äî boundary conditions, readability of pivot logic.
6. **Counting Sort** ‚Äî special-case assumptions; shows how to isolate logic.
7. **Heap Sort** ‚Äî helpful to demonstrate abstraction of heapify logic.

### üîç Searching Algorithms

Concise but easy to mess up with confusing conditions or cryptic code.

8. **Linear Search** ‚Äî overly verbose or too clever; highlights clarity vs terseness.
9. **Binary Search** ‚Äî boundary bugs galore; ideal to teach robustness and clarity.
10. **Ternary Search** ‚Äî more niche, but good to compare styles.

21. **Palindrome Checker** ‚Äî often overcomplicated; great for showcasing clean minimal code.
22. **Roman Numeral Converter** ‚Äî edge case handling, switch logic, and string processing.
23. **Slugify / String Converters (camelCase ‚Üî snake\_case)** ‚Äî good for chaining transformations.
24. **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator (Shunting Yard)** ‚Äî complex but decomposable.
25. **ISBN-10/13 Verifier** ‚Äî checksum logic, often needs clarity.

Let me know if you'd like a downloadable version (Markdown, JSON, or CSV), or a mapping to *Clean Code* principles per
problem (like naming, decomposition, duplication, etc). I can also sketch out one or two as **real Clean-Code Game
levels** to help you get started.
