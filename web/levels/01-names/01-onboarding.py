Welcome to the coding trenches, Junior! 
According to our team's ancient traditions (and your manager's trust issues), you're not allowed to write actual code yet. Your sacred duty is to review your colleagues' masterpieces and fix "small, insignificant details" - you know, the ones that cause production outages at 3 AM.

Let's start with something even you can't mess up. See that variable name that looks like someone fell asleep on their keyboard? Click to fix it before my eyes start bleeding!

##hint "That variable name is practically begging for mercy. Put it out of its misery by clicking on it!"
"""final
Congratulations! You've successfully renamed a variable without breaking the universe. Your journey to becoming slightly less junior has begun!

##final-reply "Bring on the next challenge!"
