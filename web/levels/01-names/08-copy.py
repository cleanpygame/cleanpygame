"""start
Well, well, well... someone actually wrote documentation for their code! How quaint! 

But wait - they used clear, descriptive terms in the docs, then proceeded to name their actual parameters like they were rationing letters during a keyboard shortage. It's like writing a detailed restaurant menu in beautiful prose, then serving the food in unmarked paper bags.

Let's see if we can make the code as descriptive as its documentation, shall we?

"""final
Excellent! You've transformed this function from cryptic to crystal clear. Now the code matches the quality of its documentation, making it immediately obvious what each parameter does without having to refer to the docstring. 

Remember: Good code is self-documenting. While comments and docstrings are valuable, they shouldn't be a crutch for poorly named variables. When your variable names tell the story clearly, your code becomes much easier to understand and maintain!
