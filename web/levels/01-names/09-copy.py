"""start
Well, well, well... someone actually wrote documentation for their code! How quaint! 

But wait - they used clear, descriptive terms in the docs, then proceeded to name their actual parameters like they were rationing letters during a keyboard shortage. It's like writing a detailed restaurant menu in beautiful prose, then serving the food in unmarked paper bags.

Let's see if we can make the code as descriptive as its documentation, shall we?

##replace-span - ys source

##replace-span - j dest_start
##explain "Single-letter variables like 'j' are perfect when you want your code to be as mysterious as possible. For everyone else, descriptive names like 'dest_start' make the code self-documenting."
##hint "This parameter represents a starting position in a specific array. The docstring explains which one."
##replace-span - k src_start
##explain "The letter 'k' - saving valuable keystrokes since the invention of programming! But at what cost to readability? The few extra characters in 'src_start' make the code instantly more understandable."
##hint "Similar to 'j', this parameter is also a starting position, but for a different array. Which one?"
##replace-span - n count
##explain "'n' could stand for 'number', 'node', 'noodle'... The documentation says 'number of elements to copy', so why not use a name that actually conveys that meaning?"
##hint "This parameter determines how many items get copied. What would be a clearer name than just 'n'?"
"""final
Excellent! You've transformed this function from cryptic to crystal clear. Now the code matches the quality of its documentation, making it immediately obvious what each parameter does without having to refer to the docstring. 

Remember: Good code is self-documenting. While comments and docstrings are valuable, they shouldn't be a crutch for poorly named variables. When your variable names tell the story clearly, your code becomes much easier to understand and maintain!
