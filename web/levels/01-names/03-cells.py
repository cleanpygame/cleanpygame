"""start
Well done on your previous fixes! Now your colleague has sent you this "masterpiece" of clarity. 

"It's short and simple," they said. "Probably doesn't need any changes," they said. Let's see about that... I spy with my little eye some variables that are playing hide-and-seek with their meanings!

##explain "The mysterious 'get' function! Get what? The name 'get_empty_positions' actually tells us what it returns."
##hint "get... what?!"
##replace-span - lst1 empty_positions
##explain "lst1? Is this a sequel to lst? Variable names should tell a story, not just be numbered placeholders."
##hint "List contains positions. Name it to reflect its purpose, not its sequence."
##replace-span - lst cells
##explain "Naming a list of cells 'lst' forces developers to guess. Descriptive names save brain cycles."
##hint "This parameter has objects with 'is_empty' property. What are these objects?"
##replace-span - c cell
##explain "Single-letter loop variables are mysterious characters never properly introduced. Clarity beats brevity."
##hint "What is each item in this collection? Name it properly to aid understanding."
"""final
Excellent work! You've transformed this cryptic code into something self-documenting.
Now anyone reading it can understand what it does without having to trace through the execution in their head.
Remember: code is written once but read many times, so optimizing for readability is always worth the extra keystrokes!
