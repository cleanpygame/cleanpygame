"""start
Well done on your previous fixes! Now your colleague has sent you this "masterpiece" of clarity. 

"It's short and simple," they said. "Probably doesn't need any changes," they said. Let's see about that... I spy with my little eye some variables that are playing hide-and-seek with their meanings!
"""
def get(lst):
    lst1 = []
    for c in lst:
        if c.is_empty: 
            lst1.Add(c.position)
    return lst1

lst = read_cells("cells.csv")
print(get(lst))

##replace-span - get get_empty_positions
##explain "Ah, the mysterious 'get' function! Get what exactly? Milk from the store? The joke? The function name 'get_empty_positions' actually tells us what it returns - a revolutionary concept in programming!"
##hint "This function name is about as descriptive as calling a hammer 'hit_thing'. What specific data is it actually retrieving?"
##replace-span - lst1 empty_positions
##explain "lst1? Is this a sequel to lst? Coming soon to theaters near you! Variable names should tell a story about their purpose, not just be numbered placeholders."
##hint "This variable is collecting specific positions. Maybe its name could reflect that instead of sounding like a temporary variable that overstayed its welcome?"
##replace-span - lst cells
##explain "When you name a list of cells 'lst', you're basically saying 'I want the next developer to play a guessing game'. Descriptive names save brain cycles for actual problem-solving!"
##hint "This parameter contains specific objects with properties like 'is_empty'. What might those objects be? Certainly not just any old list items..."
##replace-span - c cell
##explain "Single-letter variable names in loops are like mysterious characters in a novel who are never properly introduced. In a short loop it might be clear, but clarity always beats brevity."
##hint "This loop variable represents one item from your collection. What is each item in this collection? Naming it properly helps readers understand the code at a glance."
"""final
Excellent work! You've transformed this cryptic code into something self-documenting. Now anyone reading it can understand what it does without having to trace through the execution in their head. Remember: code is written once but read many times, so optimizing for readability is always worth the extra keystrokes!
"""
##final-reply "Ready for the next naming challenge!"
