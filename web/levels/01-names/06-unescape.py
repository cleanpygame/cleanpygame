"""start
Behold! The revolutionary naming convention from our senior developer, who insists it's "optimized for typing efficiency":

1. If a variable stores a string, name it 's' (saves 5 keystrokes over 'string'!)
2. If it stores a boolean, always name it 'flag' (what the flag means is an exciting mystery!)
3. Need multiple strings? Use 's1', 's2', etc. (sequential brilliance!)
4. But wait, there's more! For true elegance, use 'ss', 'sss', etc. (because who needs meaning when you can have repetition?)

This code works perfectly, so clearly these naming conventions are superior. Right?

##explain "Ah, the mysterious 'flag'! Flag for what? A country? A ship? A variable named 'after_slash' actually tells us what it's tracking. Remember: code is read far more often than it's written, so those extra keystrokes save hours of confusion."
##hint "This boolean is tracking a specific condition related to the previous character. What state is it actually remembering?"
##replace-span - ss unescaped
##explain "'ss'? Is that a snake hissing? A boat's distress call? Variable names should tell a story about their purpose, not just be lazy duplications of other variable names."
##hint "This string is accumulating characters, but with a specific transformation applied. What's happening to the content as it's being built?"
##replace-span - s escaped
##explain "Single-letter variable names are like mysterious characters in a novel who are never properly introduced. In some contexts (like 'i' in a short loop) they're acceptable, but parameters deserve their full identity."
##hint "This parameter contains text with a specific characteristic. What kind of string is being passed to this function?"
"""final
Excellent work! You've transformed this code from a cryptic puzzle into self-documenting code. Now anyone reading it can immediately understand what each variable represents without having to trace through the execution. Remember: the goal of variable naming isn't to save keystrokes while typing - it's to save brain cycles while reading!
