Behold! Our senior developer's "typing efficiency" naming convention:
- String variables: 's', 's1', 'ss' (saves keystrokes!)
- Booleans: always 'flag' (saves thinking time!)

This is a pure efficiency of x10 developers!

Excellent work! You've transformed this code from a cryptic puzzle into self-documenting code. Now anyone reading it can immediately understand what each variable represents without having to trace through the execution. Remember: the goal of variable naming isn't to save keystrokes while typing - it's to save brain cycles while reading!
