Do NOT change any constants here! They are magically calculated by our resident wizard who refuses to document anything.

The code works perfectly through some arcane sorcery. Touching it might summon demons or worse - break production. Proceed with extreme caution!

##explain "Great, you've replaced one magic number with... another magic number! But at least now it's calculated. It's like showing your work on a math test - you still might be wrong, but at least we can see your reasoning."

##explain "Finally! A variable name that actually explains what the value represents. Future developers (including future you) won't have to reverse-engineer your thought process to understand this code."
##hint "The variable 'n' could use a more descriptive name. What exactly are you calculating with 24*60*60?"
"""final
Congratulations on defying the "don't touch the magic constants" warning! Sometimes the most important rules to break are the ones that lead to unmaintainable code. By replacing magic numbers with clear, calculated constants, you've made this code significantly more readable and less prone to mysterious bugs. Your future self thanks you!
