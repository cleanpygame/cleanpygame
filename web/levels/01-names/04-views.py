The code works perfectly through some arcane sorcery. Touching it might summon demons or worse - break production. Proceed with extreme caution!

Congratulations on defying the "don't touch the magic constants" warning!
Sometimes the most important rules to break are the ones that lead to unmaintainable code.
By replacing magic numbers with clear, calculated constants, you've made this code significantly more readable and less prone to mysterious bugs.
Your future self thanks you!
