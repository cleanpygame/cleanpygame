"""start
Your colleague, who apparently skipped the "Parts of Speech" day in English class, has written some board game initialization code.

They proudly explained: "It is simple! The 'initialization' consists of 'creating a board' and filling it with the 'board_reader'!"

You nod politely while mentally correcting their grammar. Time to teach them the sacred rule of naming: functions do things (verbs), variables are things (nouns).

def initialization(board_json):
    n = board_json['size']
    board = creating_board(n, n)
    board_reader(board_json, board)

##replace-span - n board_size
##explain "Ah, the mysterious 'n'! Is it a secret agent? The 14th letter of the alphabet? Or perhaps... the size of the board? Single-letter variables are like secret codes that only the original developer understands."
##hint "This variable holds a specific dimension from the JSON. What dimension is it extracting from 'size'?"
##replace-span - initialization initialize_board
##explain "Functions should be verbs because they DO things! 'initialization' is the noun form - like saying 'swimming' instead of 'swim'. Your functions should sound like commands: 'create', 'calculate', 'destroy', not 'creation', 'calculation', 'destruction'."
##hint "This function is performing an action on a board. What action is it taking? Think imperative verb form."
##replace-span - creating_board create_board
##explain "'creating_board' sounds like you're narrating what you're doing: 'I am creating board now'. Function names should be direct commands: 'create_board!' It's more efficient and follows standard conventions."
##hint "This function name uses the -ing form (gerund), but function names should use the imperative form. How would you command someone to perform this action?"
##replace-span - board_reader read_board
##explain "'board_reader' sounds like a job title, not an action. Is it a person who reads boards professionally? Functions should be verbs that describe the action they perform."
##hint "This function is doing something with the board data. What specific action is it taking with the board_json?"
"""final
Excellent work! You've transformed these function and variable names to follow proper naming conventions. Functions are now verbs (actions) and variables are nouns (things), making the code much more intuitive to read.

This naming pattern creates a natural language-like flow in your code: "initialize_board takes a board_size and uses it to create_board and read_board." It reads almost like a sentence, which is exactly what good code should do!
