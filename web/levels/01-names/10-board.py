"""start
Your colleague, who apparently skipped the "Parts of Speech" day in English class, has written some board game initialization code.

They proudly explained: "It is simple! The 'initialization' consists of 'creating a board' and filling it with the 'board_reader'!"

Time to teach them the sacred rule of naming: functions — verbs, variables — nouns.

"""final
Excellent work! You've transformed these function and variable names to follow proper naming conventions. Functions are now verbs (actions) and variables are nouns (things), making the code much more intuitive to read.

This naming pattern creates a natural language-like flow in your code: "initialize_board takes a board_size and uses it to create_board and read_board." It reads almost like a sentence, which is exactly what good code should do!
